凝滞定义：①Freezing was defined in the tradition of the R.C Belles lab, as the absence of all movement, aside from that required for respiration (without regard to posture).
②the freezing response is represented by a motionless moment without any specific posture or behavioral sequence. Freezing measurements include fragmental components of several defensive behaviors that are exhibited during the session, such as behavioral inhibition, crouching, and a moment of risk assessment behavior.
其他防御行为：①Crouching: rat’s weight supported by its hindlimbs, which were contracted, with forelimbs extended（a suspended arched-back body, a straightened tail away from the ground）. Crouching is no doubt somewhat related to freezing in rats, which often exhibit this posture when scared, but it is not very apparent in mice, hence no longer preferred.
②risk assessment behaviors: include searching and assessing the environment via stretching the body back and forth (called stretch attend postures).
自动化评分系统：Video freeze software（准确性不比人工评分差）
之前的工作中常用到的一种方法：instantaneous or momentary time-sampling of behavior
利用秒表人工计量的标准：switched on whenever an animal froze, and switched off whenever the animal started moving.
用到的行为学实验：情景恐惧记忆实验，其中凝滞作为评价恐惧反应的指标（因为实验环境的限制，小鼠不能逃避也找不到容身的地方）。（1）依据的原理为巴浦洛夫条件反射，常用的恐惧刺激为电击，中性刺激为声音，光和环境刺激。（2）依据鼠对猫先天性的恐惧，利用三种气味（水，香蕉的气味，猫尿的气味）进行试验。
